# Basketball Scoreboard App

## Description
This solo project, titled "Basketball Scoreboard," was created as part of the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program to apply the basics of JavaScript I've learned independently. The site features a functional scoreboard for basketball games, allowing users to keep track of points during a game.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Applying JavaScript to create interactive web page elements.
- Manipulating the DOM to reflect real-time score updates.
- Implementing logic to handle scoring rules in basketball.
- Ensuring a user-friendly interface for score tracking.

## Setup
